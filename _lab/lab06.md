# Lab 6: Group, Join, Conditionals, Iteration, Randomness

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab06/lab06.ipynb)

Always the above link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

This week, we will get a bit more practice with grouping and joining tables, using iteration and simulations, and practicing the concept of randomness and probability. This material is covered in Chapter 9 and the prior chapters (e.g., Chapter 8.4) of the [textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/).
