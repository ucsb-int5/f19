# Lab 5: Simulations

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab05/lab05.ipynb)

Always the above link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

In this lab you will be using
* Boolean operators 
* `if` / `else` / `elif` conditional statements
* `np.random.choice(array_name)`
* functions that you defined yourself
* `apply` method for tables
* iterating over arrays using `for` loops
* simulation steps to compute different statistics
* `in` and `not in` operators to check for presence of values
* `np.append` method to add values to an array


This lab covers [Chapter 9](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/09/randomness.html) and [Chapter 10](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/10/sampling-and-empirical-distributions.html) of the textbook.
