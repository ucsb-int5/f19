# Lab 01: Expressions 

First lab using Jupyter Notebook.

Always use this link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work):

In today's lab, you'll learn how to:

1. navigate Jupyter notebooks;
2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;
3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and
4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.

This lab covers parts of Chapter 3 of the online textbook <http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html>. 
You should read the book after the lab, especially if something is unclear.
