# Lab 01: Expressions 

[First lab using Jupyter Notebook.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab01/int5-lab01.ipynb)

Always use [this link](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab01/int5-lab01.ipynb) in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

In today's lab, you'll learn how to:

1. navigate Jupyter notebooks;
2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;
3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and
4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.

This lab covers parts of Chapter 3 of the online textbook <http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html>. 
You should read the book after the lab, especially if something is unclear.
