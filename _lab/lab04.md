# Lab 4: Tables Review

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab04-practice/lab04_practice.ipynb)

Always the above link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

In this lab, we'll practice manipulating tables. You'll review how to use the table methods that we discussed in class (e.g., `select`, `column`, `sort`, `where`, `take`, `drop`). You will also get to draw a scatterplot.

This lab covers Chapter 6 and 7 (Intro) of the online textbook <http://www.inferentialthinking.com/>.
