# Lab 4: Functions and Visualizations

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab04/lab04.ipynb)

Always the above link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

In this lab, we'll continue to practice manipulating tables.
New this week is the material on creating your own functions and using the table method `apply` from Section 7.1. We'll also learn about visualization from Chapter 6 of the online textbook <http://www.inferentialthinking.com/>.
