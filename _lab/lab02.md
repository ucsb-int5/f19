# Lab 02: Data Types 

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab02/lab02.ipynb)

Always use [this link](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab02/lab02.ipynb) in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

In this lab, we'll practice working with text, importing code (and displaying pictures!), and manipulating arrays.

This lab covers Chapters 4 and 5 of the online textbook <http://www.inferentialthinking.com/>.
