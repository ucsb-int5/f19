# Lab 7: Simulation and Regression

[Here's the link to the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.](https://data1.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ucsb-int5/int5-f19-notebooks&subPath=lab07/lab07.ipynb)

Always the above link in order to see the latest version of this assignment (just refreshing the page with the opened notebook will *not* work).

This week, we will be practicing simulations and covering regression. This material is covered in Chapter 9 and Chapter 15 of the [textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/15/Prediction.html).
