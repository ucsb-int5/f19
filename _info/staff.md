  <i> "I'm a 3rd year undergrad. I started as a data science tutor last year and I'm excited to be returning for this class! I'm interested in the intersection between data science and the digital humanities & social sciences. I spent the past few months working at the local gov office for Santa Barbara County and I'll be an audit/assurance intern in the Bay Area next summer. Outside of class, I'm involved in UCSB's Associated Students and various student advocacy causes. Ask me if you're interested to learn more about any of the following: econ classes & econ major advice, student government at UCSB, or data science related research opportunities. Welcome to INT 5!" </i>

I tutored students for INT 5 last fall, and I’m excited to be back again to help you get comfortable with coding and data science! Feel free to ask me anything about programming in Python and methods for debugging your code. Also, because of my unconventional major, if you have questions about research or pursuing data science and programming activities on the side, definitely come talk to me! Other than my school activities, I am working on a data automation and analysis project with a solid-state lighting company, and I love cooking, paddle boarding, swimming, and hiking." </i>

  <h3>Sergio (Tutor)</h3>
    Pronouns: <br/>
    Major: <br/>
    Previous experience as a tutor: <br/>
  <i> "Hello INT 5. My name is Sergio Zambrano (He/Him/His) and I am a fourth-year statistics and data science major. This is my first time tutoring for a class, so I am not sure how things will turn out. However, I will try my best to help you in whichever way I can. I understand that data science is a broad term that appears very intimidating. Not too long ago, I had the same uneasy feelings towards data science that some of you are facing. I hope that my knowledge and experience in data science will be able to help some of you overcome those uneasy feelings and jumpstart your journey as data scientists. I will mainly be a resource for the material in this course but feel free to send me an email at zambranoguerra@ucsb.edu for any concerns with planning courses, career goals, or anything else. Most of my experience is in python and in R with skills that range from pandas to machine learning and now Deep Learning. I have also been part of IEEE and robotics projects that mainly deals with hardware and software. I currently intern at the YMCA corporate office where I use data science to aid me with business analytics. I previously interned at the UCSB Materials research lab which gave me the opportunity to create an acoustic levitator that will be presented at MOXI museum in Santa Barbara. My interests in academics is to improve my knowledge in Deeping Learning and my programming. My interests outside of academics are lifting, swimming, the occasional computer game, listening to music, and reading. I’m currently reading The Drunkard’s Walk and listening to Rock Ballads. I am constantly trying to read new books and listen to new songs. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Lastly, I do not know how it became a tradition, but at the start of every quarter, I get a buzzcut.
