# HW 01

_The examples in this assignment are based directly on Chapters 6.3 and 6.4 of the_ [online textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/06/3/Example_Trends_in_the_Population_of_the_United_States.html). Some information was removed and new information and questions were added in italics. Feel free to cross-reference the book to figure out how to solve the questions.

### Read all instructions carefully

**To maximize your learning and understanding of the material, we strongly recommend carefully reading the instructions and making an honest attempt at solving the problem yourself (i.e., on your own) before discussing it with anyone or asking for help.**

This assignment should be your own work, done entirely by you using your own words and solutions (using the code provided in the textbook).
By submitting this assignment, you acknowldge that you have read the information on [Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity) and verify that this assignment constitutes your own work.

**Important**: The `ok` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach).
